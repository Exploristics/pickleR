*pickleR* provides for the serializing and de-serializing of an R object structure,
similar to that seen in the Python module [pickle](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pickle.html).
*pickleR* traverses the object hierarchy, keeping track of any sub-objects it has already encountered
so that they will not be stored again. Therefore, recursive, nested and shared objects are handled by *pickleR*.

The unpickling process reconstitutes the object with shared objects and recursions intact.
